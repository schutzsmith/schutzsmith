### Hey Y'all! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking an interest in my work. I love using web development to help causes and government give their supporters and citizens interactive experiences that can help make their lives better.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several WordPress and NoCode focused side projects. Always tinkering and enjoying keeping my fingers nimble.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use WordPress as a web application platform for MVP ideas to get them to market faster and cheaper than other popular methods right now.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making WordPress more efficient through Devops and Static Deployments.
